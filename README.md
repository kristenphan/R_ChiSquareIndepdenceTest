If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and wonâ€™t do you any good.

__Assignment Description:__
<br/>
As some people might argue being religous and engaging religous activites have a positive impact on their perspectives and satisfaction. In this analysis, we will perform a chi-square test on the General Social Survey dataset (GSS) to determine whether religious engagement and financial satisfaction are associated. Out of scope for this assignment is to analyze the nature of the association (linear association ie. Correlation or non-linear), if any.
